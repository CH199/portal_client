Python-based client for downloading data files hosted by the an instance of
the portal software developed by the GDC and further modified by the
Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS). There are several portals running on the
internet to support various research efforts. Notably, the Human Microbiome
Project Data Analysis and Coordination Center (hmpdacc.org) uses the portal
to enable data exploration and download. The client accepts a *manifest file*
as an input. This file contains URLs to the files to be downloaded. Manifest
files can be generated using the shopping cart functionality of the portal's
query interface. The client supports HTTP, FTP, Amazon AWS S3, Aspera (FASP), 
and GCP (Google Cloud Platform) storage.
